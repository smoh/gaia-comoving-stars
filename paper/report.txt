Referee Report

    Reviewer's Comments:
    This is a well written paper with significant new science
    worth for publication. A statistical rigorous approach
    has been taken in analysing the Gaia TGAS data for possible
    co-moving stars, calculating the real 3-D separations of
    candidates.
    I have only a few comments for potential improvement of
    this manuscript. These are a mix of some trivial editorial
    items and a few content related items, sorted by following
    along the manuscript:

We thank the referee for his/her comments, and detail our response to each item below.

    - p.3: begin of section 2: does "Article" need to be in italic?

It has been de-italicized.

    - p.3: eq.(1): if S/N gets below 4 the sqrt becomes imaginary,
    is this correct? does this directly come out of the Lutz-Kelker
    bias or are more comments in order here?

It is correct. The distance estimator including the Lutz-Kelker bias is
the maximum of the posterior distribution assuming a prior proportional to parallax^-4
(constant density without normalization).
If the parallax S/N is less than 4, the posterior of distance does not have a
maximum.

    - p.3: line below eq.(2): I assume you mean proper motion RA*cos(Dec)
    here instead of just mu_alpha, right?

The symbol mu_alpha indeed refers to $\dot\alpha \cos(\delta)$ insead of just
$\dot\alpha$.

SMOH: hmm.. is $\mu_\alpha$ symbol incorrect?

    - p.6: eq.(7): might want to mention what "I" is (unit matrix)

Fixed.

    - p.6: eq.(8): it is a bit unfortunate that we have so many
    different meanings for "d"; maybe the distance should be called
    "r" or "D"

SMOH TODO swap d to r?

    - p.6: after eq.(11): it is not clear where those numbers for
    velocity dispersion and weights are coming from - any reference?
    maybe add some more comment why these have been adopted

    - p.8: Fig.2 lower pannel: shouldn't the color bar go the
    other direction on the left hand side diagram? stars with
    small L1/L2 ratios are on the left in the left hand side
    diagram but are on the right on the separation plot (dark
    blue color)

    - p.10: Fig.5: light blue vs. grey are not well distinguished,
    frankly I can see only sort of grey star cluster symbols,
    nothing light blue

SMOH TODO select better colors

    - p.11: provide reference to RAVE project

We added Kunder et al. 2016.

    - p.14: section 4.3: mention the headings of columns in Table 1
    explicitly in the description of that table in the text,
    e.g. missing "Ncc" and "IDcc"

    - p.15: items like index of the closest cluster, etc.: I can't
    see these in the sample Table 1

    - p.15/16: the table is already electronic (does not take up
    much space in the paper), and it is reasonably small by today's
    standard (order MB), so why not add some columns which would
    be very useful for the user, like approx. RA, Dec, G magnitude,
    G-J color, distance? these would help the user to recreate some
    of the figures in the text and do other similar plots for eg subsets
    of the data without resorting to getting the needed info via index
    to large on-line database systems

    - similarly: how about adding an angular separation column?

    - p.16: par. above summary: would it be worth looking for those
    potentially missing pairs in a set of lower L1/L2 cut data?

    - p.18: 3rd line from top: "... at git commit ( )."
    what are the empty parantheses - something missing here?
