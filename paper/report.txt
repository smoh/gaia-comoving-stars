We thank the referee for his/her comments, and detail our response to each item below.

  > - p.3: begin of section 2: does "Article" need to be in italic?

It has been de-italicized.

  > - p.3: eq.(1): if S/N gets below 4 the sqrt becomes imaginary,
  > is this correct? does this directly come out of the Lutz-Kelker
  > bias or are more comments in order here?

It is correct. The distance estimator including the Lutz-Kelker bias is the
peak of the posterior distribution of distance assuming a prior proportional to
$\varpi^{-4}$, or equivalently $d^{2}$ (constant density without normalization)
and a Gaussian noise in parallax ($\varpi$). If the parallax S/N is less than 4,
the posterior distribution of distance does not have a maximum at positive
distances.

  > - p.3: line below eq.(2): I assume you mean proper motion RA*cos(Dec)
  > here instead of just mu_alpha, right?

Yes, we changed the symbol to $\mu_{\alpha}^*$ to distinguish
with $\mu_\alpha=d(\alpha)/dt$, and added an explicit note on this.

  > - p.6: eq.(7): might want to mention what "I" is (unit matrix)

Fixed.

  > - p.6: eq.(8): it is a bit unfortunate that we have so many
  > different meanings for "d"; maybe the distance should be called
  > "r" or "D"

We changed the distance symbol throughout the document from "$d$" to "$r$".

These numbers are empirically chosen to account for the distribution of one
component velocities of the TGAS stars.

The direction of the colorbar is correct. Larger L1/L2 pairs
(darker blue points on the right panel of the bottom row) do occupy
the lower right corner on the separation vs dv_tan plane,
and are the co-moving pairs by our selection.
This should be contrasted with smaller L1/L2 pairs (lighter blue points)
more and more dominating as you go up in dv_tan (right upper corner),
which are not co-moving.

  > - p.10: Fig.5: light blue vs. grey are not well distinguished,

We changed the transparency for light blue circles (star clusters) and
color and symbol for OB Association stars.

We added Kunder et al. 2016.

Following the referee's suggestion, we augmented our catalog with additional
information.

- We first note that the columns missing from
the previous version of the manuscript ("Ncc", "IDcc", "index of the closest cluster")
were simply omitted due to the limiting width of the table, and were included
in the machine-readable table.

- We have re-organized the catalog into three tables of stars, pairs, and groups.

- We added more useful columns to the star table, including all information
that was used to make figures in this paper. 

- We decided to remove the closest cluster information as verifying the match
  between each connected component in this study and known clusters is not a
  trivial task, and it may mislead the readers.

  > - p.16: par. above summary: would it be worth looking for those
  > potentially missing pairs in a set of lower L1/L2 cut data?

Yes, we think there may be better algorithms to do clustering on the whole graph of
$\sim 270k$ pairs, but are yet to apply to the dataset.

  > - p.18: 3rd line from top: "... at git commit ( )."
  > what are the empty parentheses - something missing here?

Fixed. The hash (identifier) of the last Git commit before submission 
(in order to indicate the last history of the code relevant to the analysis
presented here) was mistakenly omitted.
We decided to make this information available at the url rather than here.

Aside from the above, we have these minor changes in the new manuscript. We

- added the reference Shaya & Olling 2011 in regards that
there is no strict cut-off in co-moving pair separation.
- added a note on projection in regards to comparing RVs.
- cleaned up Appendix B.
