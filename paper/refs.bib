	Abstract = {The nearest, youngest groups of stars to the Sun provide important samples of age-dated stars for studying circumstellar disk evolution, imaged exoplanets, and brown dwarfs. I briefly comment on the status of the known stellar groups within 100 pc: beta Pic, AB Dor, UMa, Car-Near, Tuc-Hor and beta Tuc nucleus, Hyades, Col, TW Hya, Car, Coma Ber, 32 Ori, eta Cha, and chi1 For. I also discuss some poorly characterized groups and ``non-groups.'' Grades for 2015 of Pass, Satisfactory, or Fail are assigned to the groups for the purposes of age-dating stars and brown dwarfs. I speculate that Tuc-Hor could have provided a supernova ~60 pc away ~2.2 Myr ago which showered the Earth with traces of 60Fe-bearing dust.},

@article{Bovy:2009aa,
	Abstract = {We present a three-dimensional reconstruction of the velocity distribution of nearby stars (lsim100 pc) using a maximum likelihood density estimation technique applied to the two-dimensional tangential velocities of stars. The underlying distribution is modeled as a mixture of Gaussian components. The algorithm reconstructs the error-deconvolved distribution function, even when the individual stars have unique error and missing-data properties. We apply this technique to the tangential velocity measurements from a kinematically unbiased sample of 11,865 main-sequence stars observed by the Hipparcos satellite. We explore various methods for validating the complexity of the resulting velocity distribution function, including criteria based on Bayesian model selection and how accurately our reconstruction predicts the radial velocities of a sample of stars from the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (GCS). Using this very conservative external validation test based on the GCS, we find that there is little evidence for structure in the distribution function beyond the moving groups established prior to the Hipparcos mission. This is in sharp contrast with internal tests performed here and in previous analyses, which point consistently to maximal structure in the velocity distribution. We quantify the information content of the radial velocity measurements and find that the mean amount of new information gained from a radial velocity measurement of a single star is significant. This argues for complementary radial velocity surveys to upcoming astrometric surveys.},

@article{Steinmetz:2006aa,
	Abstract = {We present the first data release of the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE), an ambitious spectroscopic survey to measure radial velocities and stellar atmosphere parameters (temperature, metallicity, and surface gravity) of up to one million stars using the Six Degree Field multiobject spectrograph on the 1.2 m UK Schmidt Telescope of the Anglo-Australian Observatory. The RAVE program started in 2003, obtaining medium-resolution spectra (median R=7500) in the Ca-triplet region (8410-8795 {\AA}) for southern hemisphere stars drawn from the Tycho-2 and SuperCOSMOS catalogs, in the magnitude range 9<I<12. The first data release is described in this paper and contains radial velocities for 24,748 individual stars (25,274 measurements when including reobservations). Those data were obtained on 67 nights between 2003 April 11 and 2004 April 3. The total sky coverage within this data release is ~4760 deg2. The average signal-to-noise ratio of the observed spectra is 29.5, and 80% of the radial velocities have uncertainties better than 3.4 km s-1. Combining internal errors and zero-point errors, the mode is found to be 2 km s-1. Repeat observations are used to assess the stability of our radial velocity solution, resulting in a variance of 2.8 km s-1. We demonstrate that the radial velocities derived for the first data set do not show any systematic trend with color or signal-to-noise ratio. The RAVE radial velocities are complemented in the data release with proper motions from Starnet 2.0, Tycho-2, and SuperCOSMOS, in addition to photometric data from the major optical and infrared catalogs (Tycho-2, USNO-B, DENIS, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey). The data release can be accessed via the RAVE Web site.},

	Abstract = {The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), one of the programs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), has now completed its systematic, homogeneous spectroscopic survey sampling all major populations of the Milky Way. After a three year observing campaign on the Sloan 2.5-m Telescope, APOGEE has collected a half million high resolution (R~22,500), high S/N (>100), infrared (1.51-1.70 microns) spectra for 146,000 stars, with time series information via repeat visits to most of these stars. This paper describes the motivations for the survey and its overall design---hardware, field placement, target selection, operations---and gives an overview of these aspects as well as the data reduction, analysis and products. An index is also given to the complement of technical papers that describe various critical survey components in detail. Finally, we discuss the achieved survey performance and illustrate the variety of potential uses of the data products by way of a number of science demonstrations, which span from time series analysis of stellar spectral variations and radial velocity variations from stellar companions, to spatial maps of kinematics, metallicity and abundance patterns across the Galaxy and as a function of age, to new views of the interstellar medium, the chemistry of star clusters, and the discovery of rare stellar species. As part of SDSS-III Data Release 12, all of the APOGEE data products are now publicly available.},

	Abstract = {We present a list of 34 neglected entries from star cluster catalogues located at relatively high galactic latitudes (|b| > 15deg) which appear to be candidate late stages of star cluster dynamical evolution. Although underpopulated with respect to usual open clusters, they still present a high number density contrast as compared to the galactic field. This was verified by means of (i) predicted model counts from different galactic subsystems in the same direction, and (ii) Guide Star Catalog equal solid angle counts for the object and surrounding fields. This suggests that the objects are physical systems, possibly star clusters in the process of disruption or their fossil remains. The sample will be useful for followup studies in view of verifying their physical nature.},

	Abstract = {The authors explore the evolution of wide binaries in the solar neighborhood driven by perturbations from passing stars and giant molecular clouds. They develop a Monte Carlo technique which exploits the fact that most perturbers encounter a wide binary at large impact parameter so that their cumulative effect may be described as a diffusion process. The rare catastrophic encounters are treated individually. It is shown that the effects of stars and clouds interact in disrupting a binary. Two possible evolutionary scenarios for the population of wide binaries are studied: (1) a "burst" model, in which a particular distribution of binaries in semimajor axis is created initially and evolved; and (2) a "continuous creation" model, in which a population is continuously created with a particular distribution in semimajor axes. The authors also address the period stability and lifetime of the proposed solar companion.},

@article{Heggie:1975aa,
	Abstract = {Numerical experiments have demonstrated something of the importance of binaries in N-body systems, and this paper aims to provide a comprehensive theoretical picture of their behavior. It begins by testing possible 'equilibrium' distributions for binaries against the results of computational experiments, but is mainly concerned with the dynamics of encounters between binaries and other members of the system. Using an impulsive approximation, it is shown that pairs with low binding energies tend to be disrupted by encounters. The theory for energetic pairs is complicated by the considerably richer variety of possible phenomena, including distant encounters in which changes in eccentricity much exceed changes in energy, and exchange events in which an incoming star may replace one component of the binary. The result of all types of encounter is that energetic pairs tend to become more energetic, at an average rate which is approximately independent of their binding energy.},

	Abstract = {We examine the dynamical destruction of binary systems in star clusters of different densities. We find that at high densities (104- 105Msolarpc-3) almost all binaries with separations >103 au are destroyed after a few crossing times. At low densities [], many binaries with separations >103 au are destroyed, and no binaries with separations >104 au survive after a few crossing times. Therefore, the binary separations in clusters can be used as a tracer of the dynamical age and past density of a cluster.  We argue that the central region of the Orion nebula cluster was ~100 times denser in the past with a half-mass radius of only 0.1-0.2 pc as (i) it is expanding, (ii) it has very few binaries with separations >103 au and (iii) it is well mixed and therefore dynamically old.  We also examine the origin of the field binary population. Binaries with separations <102 au are not significantly modified in any cluster, therefore at these separations the field reflects the sum of all star formation. Binaries with separations in the range 102- 104 au are progressively more and more heavily affected by dynamical disruption in increasingly dense clusters. If most star formation is clustered, these binaries must be overproduced relative to the field. Finally, no binary with a separation >104 au can survive in any cluster and so must be produced by isolated star formation, but only if all isolated star formation produces extremely wide binaries.},

	Abstract = {We present the Sloan Low-mass Wide Pairs of Kinematically Equivalent Stars (SLoWPoKES), a catalog of 1342 very-wide (projected separation gsim500 AU), low-mass (at least one mid-K to mid-M dwarf component) common proper motion pairs identified from astrometry, photometry, and proper motions in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A Monte Carlo-based Galactic model is constructed to assess the probability of chance alignment for each pair; only pairs with a probability of chance alignment <=0.05 are included in the catalog. The overall fidelity of the catalog is expected to be 98.35%. The selection algorithm is purposely exclusive to ensure that the resulting catalog is efficient for follow-up studies of low-mass pairs. The SLoWPoKES catalog is the largest sample of wide, low-mass pairs to date and is intended as an ongoing community resource for detailed study of bona fide systems. Here, we summarize the general characteristics of the SLoWPoKES sample and present preliminary results describing the properties of wide, low-mass pairs. While the majority of the identified pairs are disk dwarfs, there are 70 halo subdwarf (SD) pairs and 21 white dwarf-disk dwarf pairs, as well as four triples. Most SLoWPoKES pairs violate the previously defined empirical limits for maximum angular separation or binding energies. However, they are well within the theoretical limits and should prove very useful in putting firm constraints on the maximum size of binary systems and on different formation scenarios. We find a lower limit to the wide binary frequency (WBF) for the mid-K to mid-M spectral types that constitute our sample to be 1.1%. This frequency decreases as a function of Galactic height, indicating a time evolution of the WBF. In addition, the semi-major axes of the SLoWPoKES systems exhibit a distinctly bimodal distribution, with a break at separations around 0.1 pc that is also manifested in the system binding energy. Compared with theoretical predictions for the disruption of binary systems with time, we conclude that the SLoWPoKES sample comprises two populations of wide binaries: an "old" population of tightly bound systems, and a "young" population of weakly bound systems that will not survive more than a few Gyr. The SLoWPoKES catalog and future ancillary data are publicly available on the Internet for utilization by the astronomy community.},

	Abstract = {Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 6, we construct two independent samples of candidate stellar wide binaries selected (1) as pairs of unresolved sources with angular separation in the range 3''-16'', and (2) as common proper motion pairs with 5''-30'' angular separation, and make them publicly available. These samples are dominated by disk stars, and we use them to constrain the shape of the main-sequence photometric parallax relation Mr(r - i) and to study the properties of wide binary systems. We estimate Mr(r - i) by searching for a relation that minimizes the difference between distance moduli of primary and secondary components of wide binary candidates. We model Mr(r - i) by a fourth degree polynomial and determine the coefficients independently for each sample using Markov chain Monte Carlo fitting. Aided by the derived photometric parallax relation, we construct a series of high-quality catalogs of candidate main-sequence binary stars. Using these catalogs, we study the distribution of semimajor axes of wide binaries, a, in the 2000 AU < a < 47,000 AU range. We find the observations to be well described by the {\"O}pik distribution, f(a) propto 1/a, for a < abreak, where abreak increases roughly linearly with the height Z above the Galactic plane [abreak propto 12,300 Z(kpc)0.7 AU]. The number of wide binary systems with 100 AU < a < abreak, as a fraction of the total number of stars, decreases from 0.9% at Z = 0.5 kpc to 0.5% at Z = 3 kpc. The probability for a star to be in a wide binary system is independent of its color. Given this color, the companions of red components seem to be drawn randomly from the stellar luminosity function, while blue components have a larger blue-to-red companion ratio than expected from the luminosity function.},

	Abstract = {An unbiased sample of 164 primary G-dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood are studied with the aid of 4200 radial velocities obtained during almost 13 yrs. Several present-day distributions of the orbital elements are derived. For systems with M(2)/M(1) above 0.1 in the nearby G-dwarf sample, the following results are obtained: (1) The orbital period distribution is unimodal and can be approximated by a Gaussian-type relation with a median period of 180 yrs. (2) The short binaries are circularized up to orbital periods of about 11 d due to the tidal evolution effects - a result compatible with the mean age of the Galactic disk. (3) The tight binaries not affected by tidal effects (in the range between 11 and 1000 d) may reflect the initial binary formation process, and they have a mean eccentricity of 0.31 +/-0.04. For systems with M(2)/M(1) not greater than 0.1, the proportion of brown dwarf companions among the IAU velocity standards is estimated at 10 percent of the primaries, a value in good agreement with that found in the G-dwarf sample.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a comprehensive assessment of companions to solar-type stars. A sample of 454 stars, including the Sun, was selected from the Hipparcos catalog with pi>40 mas, sigmapi/pi < 0.05, 0.5 <= B - V <= 1.0 (~F6-K3), and constrained by absolute magnitude and color to exclude evolved stars. These criteria are equivalent to selecting all dwarf and subdwarf stars within 25 pc with V-band flux between 0.1 and 10 times that of the Sun, giving us a physical basis for the term "solar-type." New observational aspects of this work include surveys for (1) very close companions with long-baseline interferometry at the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array, (2) close companions with speckle interferometry, and (3) wide proper-motion companions identified by blinking multi-epoch archival images. In addition, we include the results from extensive radial-velocity monitoring programs and evaluate companion information from various catalogs covering many different techniques. The results presented here include four new common proper-motion companions discovered by blinking archival images. Additionally, the spectroscopic data searched reveal five new stellar companions. Our synthesis of results from many methods and sources results in a thorough evaluation of stellar and brown dwarf companions to nearby Sun-like stars. The overall observed fractions of single, double, triple, and higher-order systems are 56% $\pm$ 2%, 33% $\pm$ 2%, 8% $\pm$ 1%, and 3% $\pm$ 1%, respectively, counting all confirmed stellar and brown dwarf companions. If all candidate, i.e., unconfirmed, companions identified are found to be real, the percentages would change to 54% $\pm$ 2%, 34% $\pm$ 2%, 9% $\pm$ 2%, and 3% $\pm$ 1%, respectively. Our completeness analysis indicates that only a few undiscovered companions remain in this well-studied sample, implying that the majority (54% $\pm$ 2%) of solar-type stars are single, in contrast to the results of prior multiplicity studies. Our sample is large enough to enable a check of the multiplicity dependence on various physical parameters by analyzing appropriate subsamples. Bluer, more massive stars are seen as more likely to have companions than redder, less massive ones, consistent with the trend seen over the entire spectral range. Systems with larger interaction cross sections, i.e., those with more than two components or long orbital periods, are preferentially younger, suggesting that companions may be stripped over time by dynamical interactions. We confirm the planet-metallicity correlation (i.e., higher metallicity stars are more likely to host planets), but are unable to check it for brown dwarfs due to the paucity of such companions, implying that the brown dwarf desert extends over all separation regimes. We find no correlation between stellar companions and metallicity for B - V < 0.625, but among the redder subset, metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] <-0.3) are more likely to have companions with a 2.4sigma significance. The orbital-period distribution of companions is unimodal and roughly log normal with a peak and median of about 300 years. The period-eccentricity relation shows the expected circularization for periods below 12 days, caused by tidal forces over the age of the Galaxy, followed by a roughly flat distribution. The mass-ratio distribution shows a preference for like-mass pairs, which occur more frequently in relatively close pairs. The fraction of planet hosts among single, binary, and multiple systems are statistically indistinguishable, suggesting that planets are as likely to form around single stars as they are around components of binary or multiple systems with sufficiently wide separations. This, along with the preference of long orbital periods among stellar systems, increases the space around stars conducive for planet formation, and perhaps life.},

@article{Helmi:2016aa,
	Abstract = {The hierarchical structure formation model predicts that stellar halos should form, at least partly, via mergers. If this was a predominant formation channel for the Milky Way's halo, imprints of this merger history in the form of moving groups or streams should exist also in the vicinity of the Sun. Here we study the kinematics of halo stars in the Solar neighbourhood using the very recent first data release from the Gaia mission, and in particular the TGAS dataset, in combination with data from the RAVE survey. Our aim is to determine the amount of substructure present in the phase-space distribution of halo stars that could be linked to merger debris. To characterise kinematic substructure, we measure the velocity correlation function in our sample of halo (low metallicity) stars. We also study the distribution of these stars in the space of energy and two components of the angular momentum, in what we call "Integrals of Motion" space. The velocity correlation function reveals substructure in the form of an excess of pairs of stars with similar velocities, well above that expected for a smooth distribution. Comparison to cosmological simulations of the formation of stellar halos indicate that the levels found are consistent with the Galactic halo having been built fully via accretion. Similarly, the distribution of stars in the space of "Integrals of motion" is highly complex. A strikingly high fraction (between 58% and upto 84%) of the stars that are somewhat less bound than the Sun are on (highly) retrograde orbits. A simple comparison to Milky Way-mass galaxies in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations suggests that less than 1% have such prominently retrograde outer halos. We also identify several other statistically significant structures in "Integrals of Motion" space that could potentially be related to merger events.},

	Abstract = {Astrometric data from the recent Gaia Data Release 1 has been matched against the sample of stars from Kepler with known rotation periods. A total of 1,299 bright rotating stars were recovered from the subset of Gaia sources with good astrometric solutions, most with temperatures hotter than 5000 K. From these sources, 894 were selected as lying near the main sequence using their absolute G-band magnitudes. These main sequence stars show a bimodality in their rotation period distribution, centered roughly around a 600 Myr rotation-isochrone. This feature matches the bimodal period distribution found in cooler stars with Kepler, but was previously undetected for solar-type stars due to sample contamination by subgiants. A tenuous connection between the rotation period and total proper motion is found, suggesting the period bimodality is due to the age distribution of stars within ~300pc of the Sun, rather than a phase of rapid angular momentum loss. This work emphasizes the unique power for understanding stellar populations by combining temporal monitoring from Kepler with astrometric data from Gaia.},

	Abstract = {Context. The Gaia satellite will observe about one billion stars and other point-like sources. The astrometric core solution will determine the astrometric parameters (position, parallax, and proper motion) for a subset of these sources, using a global solution approach which must also include a large number of parameters for the satellite attitude and optical instrument. The accurate and efficient implementation of this solution is an extremely demanding task, but crucial for the outcome of the mission.  Aims: We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the mathematical and physical models applicable to this solution, as well as its numerical and algorithmic framework.  Methods: The astrometric core solution is a simultaneous least-squares estimation of about half a billion parameters, including the astrometric parameters for some 100 million well-behaved so-called primary sources. The global nature of the solution requires an iterative approach, which can be broken down into a small number of distinct processing blocks (source, attitude, calibration and global updating) and auxiliary processes (including the frame rotator and selection of primary sources). We describe each of these processes in some detail, formulate the underlying models, from which the observation equations are derived, and outline the adopted numerical solution methods with due consideration of robustness and the structure of the resulting system of equations. Appendices provide brief introductions to some important mathematical tools (quaternions and B-splines for the attitude representation, and a modified Cholesky algorithm for positive semidefinite problems) and discuss some complications expected in the real mission data.  Results: A complete software system called AGIS (Astrometric Global Iterative Solution) is being built according to the methods described in the paper. Based on simulated data for 2 million primary sources we present some initial results, demonstrating the basic mathematical and numerical validity of the approach and, by a reasonable extrapolation, its practical feasibility in terms of data management and computations for the real mission.},

@article{Rojas-Ayala:2012aa,
	Abstract = {We present K-band spectra for 133 nearby (d < 33 ps) M dwarfs, including 18 M dwarfs with reliable metallicity estimates (as inferred from an FGK type companion), 11 M dwarf planet hosts, more than 2/3 of the M dwarfs in the northern 8 pc sample, and several M dwarfs from the LSPM catalog. From these spectra, we measure equivalent widths of the Ca and Na lines, and a spectral index quantifying the absorption due to H2O opacity (the H2O-K2 index). Using empirical spectral type standards and synthetic models, we calibrate the H2O-K2 index as an indicator of an M dwarf's spectral type and effective temperature. We also present a revised relationship that estimates the [Fe/H] and [M/H] metallicities of M dwarfs from their Na I, Ca I, and H2O-K2 measurements. Comparisons to model atmosphere provide a qualitative validation of our approach, but also reveal an overall offset between the atomic line strengths predicted by models as compared to actual observations. Our metallicity estimates also reproduce expected correlations with Galactic space motions and Halpha emission line strengths, and return statistically identical metallicities for M dwarfs within a common multiple system. Finally, we find systematic residuals between our H2O-based spectral types and those derived from optical spectral features with previously known sensitivity to stellar metallicity, such as TiO, and identify the CaH1 index as a promising optical index for diagnosing the metallicities of near-solar M dwarfs.},

@article{Ibata:1994aa,
	Abstract = {WE have detected a large, extended group of comoving stars in the direction of the Galactic Centre, which we interpret as belonging to a dwarf galaxy that is closer to our own Galaxy than any other yet known. Located in the constellation of Sagittarius, and on the far side of the Galactic Centre, it has not previously been seen because of the large number of foreground stars (in the Milky Way) in that direction. Following convention, we propose to call it the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Its properties are similar to those of the eight other dwarf spheroidal companions to the Milky Way, and it is comparable in size and luminosity to the largest of them- the Fornax system. The Sagittarius dwarf is elongated towards the plane of the Milky Way, suggesting that it is undergoing some tidal disruption before being absorbed by the Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We look for common proper motion companions to stars of the nearby young beta Pictoris moving group.  Methods: First, we compiled a list of 185 beta Pictoris members and candidate members from 35 representative works. Next, we used the Aladin and STILTS virtual observatory tools and the PPMXL proper motion and Washington Double Star catalogues to look for companion candidates. The resulting potential companions were subjects of a dedicated astro-photometric follow-up using public data from all-sky surveys. After discarding 67 sources by proper motion and 31 by colour-magnitude diagrams, we obtained a final list of 36 common proper motion systems. The binding energy of two of them is perhaps too small to be considered physically bound.  Results: Of the 36 pairs and multiple systems, eight are new, 16 have only one stellar component previously classified as a beta Pictoris member, and three have secondaries at or below the hydrogen-burning limit. Sixteen stars are reported here for the first time as moving group members. The unexpected large number of high-order multiple systems, 12 triples and two quadruples among 36 systems, may suggest a biased list of members towards close binaries or an increment of the high-order-multiple fraction for very wide systems.},

	Abstract = {We perform a search for faint, common proper motion companions of Hipparcos stars using the recently published L{\'e}pine-Shara Proper Motion-North catalog of stars with proper motion mu>0.15'' yr-1. Our survey uncovers a total of 521 systems with angular separations 3''<Deltatheta<1500'', with 15 triples and 1 quadruple. Our new list of wide systems with Hipparcos primaries includes 130 systems identified here for the first time, including 44 in which the secondary star has V>15.0. Our census is statistically complete for secondaries with angular separations 20''<Deltatheta<300'' and apparent magnitudes V<19.0. Overall, we find that at least 9.5% of nearby (d<100 pc) Hipparcos stars have distant stellar companions with projected orbital separations s>1000 AU. We observe that the distribution in orbital separations is consistent with {\"O}pik's law, f(s)ds~s-1ds, only up to a separation s~4000 AU, beyond which it follows a more steeply decreasing power law f(s)ds~s-lds with l=1.6+/-0.1. We also find that the luminosity function of the secondaries is significantly different from that of the single stars' field population, showing a relative deficiency in low-luminosity (8<MV<14) objects. The observed trends suggest either a formation mechanism biased against low-mass companions, or a disruption over time of systems with low gravitational binding energy.},

@article{Chaname:2004aa,
	Abstract = {We present a catalog of 1147 candidate common proper motion binaries selected from the revised New Luyten Two-Tenths Catalog (NLTT). Among these, we identify 999 genuine physical pairs using the measured proper-motion difference and the relative positions of each binary's components on a reduced proper motion (RPM) diagram. The RPM positions also serve to classify them as either disk main-sequence pairs (801), halo subdwarf (116) pairs, or pairs containing at least one white dwarf (82). The disk and halo samples are complete to separations of Deltatheta=500'' and Deltatheta=900'', which correspond to ~0.1 and ~1 pc, respectively. At wide separations, both distributions are well described by single power laws dN/dDeltatheta~(Deltatheta)-alpha, with alpha=1.67+/-0.07 for the disk and alpha=1.55+/-0.10 for the halo. The fact that these distributions have similar slopes (and similar normalizations as well) argues for similarity of the star formation conditions of these two populations. The fact that the halo binaries obey a single power law out to ~1 pc permits strong constraints on halo dark matter candidates. At somewhat closer separations (10''<~Deltatheta<~25''), the disk distribution shows a pronounced flattening, which is detected at very high statistical significance and is not due to any obvious systematic effect. We also present a list of 11 previously unknown halo stars with parallaxes that are recognized here as companions of Hipparcos stars.},

	Abstract = {A catalogue of 122 wide binaries is presented. The list was compiled by searching for common proper-motion companions to the more than 1200 high-velocity and metal-poor stars of Schuster and collaborators. We study the separations for the wide binaries (< a> > 25 AU), and find that they follow Oepik's distribution all the way up to 10 000 AU. A subgroup of them, the ones with the most halo-like orbits, follow Oepik's distribution up to 20 000 AU. The galactic orbits of all systems are calculated, and galactic orbital parameters are used, along with the metallicites, to assign each one to the old thin disk, the thick disk, or the halo population.

	Abstract = {A catalogue of nearby wide double and multiple systems is presented. It contains 305 binaries, 26 triples and 3 quadruples closer to the Sun than 22.5 pc (pi >= 0.044" and with mutual separations larger than 25 AU. The catalogue includes updated astrometric, photometric and kinematic data, as well as information on possible membership to moving groups, and an age classification into probably young (PYS) and probably old system (POS). The basis for this list is Gliese's Catalogue of Nearby Stars, with additional information from Luyten's LDS and NLTT. The catalogue is found to be reasonably complete to absolute visual magnitude 13 in a volume of radius 13 pc. Several tests were performed in order to exclude as far as possible optical members. Among the 305 binaries 211 POS and 94 PVS were found, and among the 29 multiple systems 12 POS and 17 PYS. Space velocity dispersions have been calculated for the systems classified as probably old or young. Significant differences between both groups are found. The velocity dispersion found for the young group is sigmay(PYS) = 35.2 km s-1, while that of the old group is sigmay(POS) = 53.7 km s-1. The kinematic ages corresponding to these velocity dispersions are tau(PYS) = 1.9×109yrs, tau(POS) = 4.6×109yrs. 32 systems are probable members of the Hyades supercluster and 14 of Sirius. The intrinsic fraction of wide double and multiple stars to field stars is about 0.2 in the solar vicinity.},

	Abstract = {The velocity distribution of nearby stars (lsim100 pc) contains many overdensities or "moving groups," clumps of comoving stars, that are inconsistent with the standard assumption of an axisymmetric, time-independent, and steady-state Galaxy. We study the age and metallicity properties of the low-velocity moving groups based on the reconstruction of the local velocity distribution in Paper I of this series. We perform stringent, conservative hypothesis testing to establish for each of these moving groups whether it could conceivably consist of a coeval population of stars. We conclude that they do not: the moving groups are neither trivially associated with their eponymous open clusters nor with any other inhomogeneous star formation event. Concerning a possible dynamical origin of the moving groups, we test whether any of the moving groups has a higher or lower metallicity than the background population of thin disk stars, as would generically be the case if the moving groups are associated with resonances of the bar or spiral structure. We find clear evidence that the Hyades moving group has higher than average metallicity and weak evidence that the Sirius moving group has lower than average metallicity, which could indicate that these two groups are related to the inner Lindblad resonance of the spiral structure. Further, we find weak evidence that the Hercules moving group has higher than average metallicity, as would be the case if it is associated with the bar's outer Lindblad resonance. The Pleiades moving group shows no clear metallicity anomaly, arguing against a common dynamical origin for the Hyades and Pleiades groups. Overall, however, the moving groups are barely distinguishable from the background population of stars, raising the likelihood that the moving groups are associated with transient perturbations.},

@article{Holberg:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Approximately 70 per cent of the nearby white dwarfs appear to be single stars, with the remainder being members of binary or multiple star systems. The most numerous and most easily identifiable systems are those in which the main-sequence companion is an M star, since even if the systems are unresolved the white dwarf either dominates or is at least competitive with the luminosity of the companion at optical wavelengths. Harder to identify are systems where the non-degenerate component has a spectral type earlier than M0 and the white dwarf becomes the less luminous component. Taking Sirius as the prototype, these latter systems are referred to here as `Sirius like'. There are currently 98 known Sirius-like systems. Studies of the local white dwarf population within 20 pc indicate that approximately 8 per cent of all white dwarfs are members of Sirius-like systems, yet beyond 20 pc the frequency of known Sirius-like systems declines to between 1 and 2 per cent, indicating that many more of these systems remain to be found. Estimates are provided for the local space density of Sirius-like systems and their relative frequency among both the local white dwarf population and the local population of A to K main-sequence stars. The great majority of currently unidentified Sirius-like systems will likely turn out to be closely separated and unresolved binaries. Ways to observationally detect and study these systems are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We develop Bayesian statistical methods for discovering and assigning probabilities to non-random (e.g., physical) stellar companions. These companions are either presently bound or were previously bound. The probabilities depend on similarities in corrected proper motion parallel and perpendicular to the brighter component's motion, parallax, and the local phase-space density of field stars. Control experiments are conducted to understand the behavior of false positives. The technique is applied to the Hipparcos Catalogue within 100 pc. This is the first all-sky survey to locate escaped companions still drifting along with each other. In the <100 pc distance range, ~220 high probability companions with separations between 0.01 and 1 pc are found. The first evidence for a population (~300) of companions separated by 1-8 pc is found. We find these previously unnoticed naked-eye companions (both with V < 6th mag): Capella & 50 Per, delta Vel & HIP 43797, Alioth (epsilon UMa), Megrez (delta UMa) & Alcor, gamma & tau Cen, phi Eri & eta Hor, 62 & 63 Cnc, gamma & tau Per, zeta & delta Hya, beta01, beta02 & beta03 Tuc, N Vel & HIP 47479, HIP 98174 & HIP 97646, and s Eri & HIP 14913. High probability fainter companions (>6th mag) of primaries with V < 4 are found for: Fomalhaut (alpha PsA), gamma UMa, alpha Lib, Alvahet (iota Cephi), delta Ara, beta Ser, iota Peg, beta Pic, kappa Phe, and gamma Tuc.},

	Abstract = {A catalog of common-proper-motion (CPM) companions to stars within 67 pc of the Sun is constructed based on the SUPERBLINK proper-motion survey. It contains 1392 CPM pairs with angular separations 30'' < rho < 1800'', relative proper motion between the two components less than 25 mas yr-1, and magnitudes and colors of the secondaries consistent with those of dwarfs in the (MV , V - J) diagram. In addition, we list 21 candidate white dwarf CPM companions with separations under 300'', about half of which should be physical. We estimate a 0.31 fraction of pairs with red dwarf companions to be physical systems (about 425 objects), while the rest (mostly wide pairs) are chance alignments. For each candidate companion, the probability of a physical association is evaluated. The distribution of projected separations s of the physical pairs between 2 kAU and 64 kAU follows f(s)vprops -1.5, which decreases faster than {\"O}pik's law. We find that solar-mass dwarfs have no less than 4.4% $\pm$ 0.3% companions with separations larger than 2 kAU, or 3.8% $\pm$ 0.3% per decade of orbital separation in the 2-16 kAU range. The distribution of mass ratio of those wide companions is approximately uniform in the 0.1 < q < 1.0 range, although we observe a dip at q ~= 0.5 which, if confirmed, could be evidence of bimodal distribution of companion masses. New physical CPM companions to two exoplanet host stars are discovered.},

	Abstract = {We study the orbital evolution of wide binary stars in the solar neighbourhood due to gravitational perturbations from passing stars. We include the effects of the Galactic tidal field and continue to follow the stars after they become unbound. For a wide variety of initial semimajor axes and formation times, we find that the number density (stars per unit logarithmic interval in projected separation) exhibits a minimum at a few times the Jacobi radius rJ, which equals 1.7pc for a binary of solar-mass stars. The density peak interior to this minimum arises from the primordial distribution of bound binaries, and the exterior density, which peaks at a separation of ~100-300pc, arises from formerly bound binaries that are slowly drifting apart. The exterior peak gives rise to a significant long-range correlation in the positions and velocities of disc stars that should be detectable in large astrometric surveys such as Gaia that can measure accurate three-dimensional distances and velocities.},

	Abstract = {Context. This study has been developed in the framework of the computational simulations that are executed for the preparation of the ESA Gaia astrometric mission.  Aims: We focus on describing the objects and characteristics that Gaia will potentially observe without taking into consideration instrumental effects (detection efficiency, observing errors).  Methods: The theoretical Universe model prepared for the Gaia simulation has been statistically analysed at a given time. Ingredients of the model are described, with the greatest emplasis on the stellar content, the double and multiple stars, and variability.  Results: In this simulation the errors have not yet been included. Hence we estimated the number of objects and their theoretical photometric, astrometric and spectroscopic characteristics if they are perfectly detected. We show that Gaia will be able to potentially observe 1.1 billion of stars (single or part of multiple star systems) of which about 2% are variable stars and 3% have one or two exoplanets. At the extragalactic level, observations will be potentially composed of several millions of galaxies, half a million to 1 million quasars and about 50 000 supernovae that will occur during the five years of the mission.

@article{de-Zeeuw:1999aa,
	Abstract = {A comprehensive census of the stellar content of the OB associations within 1 kpc from the Sun is presented, based on Hipparcos positions, proper motions, and parallaxes. It is a key part of a long-term project to study the formation, structure, and evolution of nearby young stellar groups and related star-forming regions. OB associations are unbound ``moving groups,'' which can be detected kinematically because of their small internal velocity dispersion. The nearby associations have a large extent on the sky, which traditionally has limited astrometric membership determination to bright stars (V<~6 mag), with spectral types earlier than ~B5. The Hipparcos measurements allow a major improvement in this situation. Moving groups are identified in the Hipparcos Catalog by combining de Bruijne's refurbished convergent point method with the ``Spaghetti method'' of Hoogerwerf & Aguilar. Astrometric members are listed for 12 young stellar groups, out to a distance of ~650 pc. These are the three subgroups Upper Scorpius, Upper Centaurus Lupus, and Lower Centaurus Crux of Sco OB2, as well as Vel OB2, Tr 10, Col 121, Per OB2, alpha Persei (Per OB3), Cas-Tau, Lac OB1, Cep OB2, and a new group in Cepheus, designated as Cep OB6. The selection procedure corrects the list of previously known astrometric and photometric B- and A-type members in these groups and identifies many new members, including a significant number of F stars, as well as evolved stars, e.g., the Wolf-Rayet stars gamma^2 Vel (WR 11) in Vel OB2 and EZ CMa (WR 6) in Col 121, and the classical Cepheid delta Cep in Cep OB6. Membership probabilities are given for all selected stars. Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the expected number of interloper field stars. In the nearest associations, notably in Sco OB2, the later-type members include T Tauri objects and other stars in the final pre-main-sequence phase. This provides a firm link between the classical high-mass stellar content and ongoing low-mass star formation. Detailed studies of these 12 groups, and their relation to the surrounding interstellar medium, will be presented elsewhere. Astrometric evidence for moving groups in the fields of R CrA, CMa OB1, Mon OB1, Ori OB1, Cam OB1, Cep OB3, Cep OB4, Cyg OB4, Cyg OB7, and Sct OB2, is inconclusive. OB associations do exist in many of these regions, but they are either at distances beyond ~500 pc where the Hipparcos parallaxes are of limited use, or they have unfavorable kinematics, so that the group proper motion does not distinguish it from the field stars in the Galactic disk. The mean distances of the well-established groups are systematically smaller than the pre-Hipparcos photometric estimates. While part of this may be caused by the improved membership lists, a recalibration of the upper main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram may be called for. The mean motions display a systematic pattern, which is discussed in relation to the Gould Belt. Six of the 12 detected moving groups do not appear in the classical list of nearby OB associations. This is sometimes caused by the absence of O stars, but in other cases a previously known open cluster turns out to be (part of) an extended OB association. The number of unbound young stellar groups in the solar neighborhood may be significantly larger than thought previously.},

@article{Kharchenko:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Aims: In this study we determine absolute integrated magnitudes in the J,H,KS passbands for Galactic star clusters from the Milky Way Star Clusters survey. In the wide solar neighbourhood, we derive the open cluster luminosity function (CLF) for different cluster ages.  Methods: The integrated magnitudes are based on uniform cluster membership derived from the 2MAst catalogue (a merger of the PPMXL and 2MASS) and are computed by summing up the individual luminosities of the most reliable cluster members. We discuss two different techniques of constructing the CLF, a magnitude-limited and a distance-limited approach.  Results: Absolute J,H,KS integrated magnitudes are obtained for 3061 open clusters, and 147 globular clusters. The integrated magnitudes and colours are accurate to about 0.8 and 0.2 mag, respectively. Based on the sample of open clusters we construct the general cluster luminosity function in the solar neighbourhood in the three passbands. In each passband the CLF shows a linear part covering a range of 6 to 7 mag at the bright end. The CLFs reach their maxima at an absolute magnitude of -2 mag, then drop by one order of magnitude. During cluster evolution, the CLF changes its slope within tight, but well-defined limits. The CLF of the youngest clusters has a steep slope of about 0.4 at bright magnitudes and a quasi-flat portion for faint clusters. For the oldest population, we find a flatter function with a slope of about 0.2. The CLFs at Galactocentric radii smaller than that of the solar circle differ from those in the direction of the Galactic anti-centre. The CLF in the inner area is flatter and the cluster surface density higher than the local one. In contrast, the CLF is somewhat steeper than the local one in the outer disk, and the surface density is lower.

	Abstract = {Aims: On the basis of the PPMXL star catalogue we performed a survey of star clusters in the second quadrant of the Milky Way.  Methods: From the PPMXL catalogue of positions and proper motions we took the subset of stars with near-infrared photometry from 2MASS and added the remaining 2MASS stars without proper motions (called 2MAst, i.e. 2MASS with astrometry). We developed a data-processing pipeline including interactive human control of a standardised set of multi-dimensional diagrams to determine kinematic and photometric membership probabilities for stars in a cluster region. The pipeline simultaneously produced the astrophysical parameters of a cluster. From literature we compiled a target list of presently known open and globular clusters, cluster candidates, associations, and moving groups. From established member stars we derived spatial parameters (coordinates of centres and radii of the main morphological parts of clusters) and cluster kinematics (average proper motions and sometimes radial velocities). For distance, reddening, and age determination we used specific sets of theoretical isochrones. Tidal parameters were obtained by a fit of three-parameter King profiles to the observed density distributions of members.  Results: We investigated all 871 objects in the 2nd Galactic quadrant, of which we successfully treated 642 open clusters, 2 globular clusters, and 8 stellar associations. The remaining 219 objects (24%) were recognised by us to be nonexistent clusters, duplicate entries, or clusters too faint for 2MAst. We found that our sample is complete in the 2nd quadrant up to a distance of 2 kpc, where the average surface density is 94 clusters per kpc2. Compared with literature values we found good agreement in spatial and kinematic data, as well as for optical distances and reddening. Small, but systematic offsets were detected in the age determination.

	Abstract = {Context. Although they are the main constituents of the Galactic disk population, for half of the open clusters in the Milky Way reported in the literature nothing is known except the raw position and an approximate size.  Aims: The main goal of this study is to determine a full set of uniform spatial, structural, kinematic, and astrophysical parameters for as many known open clusters as possible.  Methods: On the basis of stellar data from PPMXL and 2MASS, we used a dedicated data-processing pipeline to determine kinematic and photometric membership probabilities for stars in a cluster region.  Results: For an input list of 3784 targets from the literature, we confirm that 3006 are real objects, the vast majority of them are open clusters, but associations and globular clusters are also present. For each confirmed object we determined the exact position of the cluster centre, the apparent size, proper motion, distance, colour excess, and age. For about 1500 clusters, these basic astrophysical parameters have been determined for the first time. For the bulk of the clusters we also derived the tidal radius. We estimated additionally average radial velocities for more than 30% of the confirmed clusters. The present sample (called MWSC) reaches both the central parts of the Milky Way and its outer regions. It is almost complete up to 1.8 kpc from the Sun and also covers neighbouring spiral arms. However, for a small subset of the oldest open clusters (log t ≳ 9) we found some evidence of incompleteness within about 1 kpc from the Sun.

	Abstract = {Context. The first release of astrometric data from Gaia will contain the mean stellar positions and magnitudes from the first year of observations, and proper motions from the combination of Gaia data with Hipparcos prior information (HTPM).  Aims: We study the potential of using the positions from the Tycho-2 Catalogue as additional information for a joint solution with early Gaia data. We call this the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution (TGAS).  Methods: We adapt Gaia's Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) to incorporate Tycho information, and use simulated Gaia observations to demonstrate the feasibility of TGAS and to estimate its performance.  Results: Using six to twelve months of Gaia data, TGAS could deliver positions, parallaxes, and annual proper motions for the 2.5 million Tycho-2 stars, with sub-milliarcsecond accuracy. TGAS overcomes some of the limitations of the HTPM project and allows its execution half a year earlier. Furthermore, if the parallaxes from Hipparcos are not incorporated in the solution, they can be used as a consistency check of the TGAS/HTPM results.},

	Abstract = {The Tycho-2 Catalogue presented here is an astrometric reference catalogue containing positions and proper motions as well as two-colour photometric data for the 2.5 million brightest stars in the sky. The Tycho-2 positions and magnitudes are based on precisely the same observations as the original Tycho Catalogue (hereafter Tycho-1) collected by the star mapper of the ESA Hipparcos satellite, but Tycho-2 is much bigger and slightly more precise, owing to a more advanced reduction technique. Components of double stars with separations down to 0.8 arcsec are included. Proper motions precise to about 2.5 mas/yr are given as derived from a comparison with the Astrographic Catalogue and 143 other ground-based astrometric catalogues, all reduced to the Hipparcos celestial coordinate system. Tycho-2 supersedes in most applications Tycho-1, as well as the ACT and TRC catalogues based on Tycho-1. Based on observations made with the ESA Hipparcos astrometry satellite. The catalogue is distributed on CD-ROM and through the astronomical data centres, and further information is given on the website http://www.astro.ku.dk/~erik/Tycho-2.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an example where the morphology of a single stellar stream can be used to rule out a specific galactic potential form without the need for velocity information. We investigate the globular cluster Palomar 5 (Pal 5), which is tidally disrupting into a cold, thin stream mapped over 22 deg on the sky with a typical width of 0.7 deg. We generate models of this stream by fixing Pal 5's present-day position, distance, and radial velocity via observations, while allowing its proper motion to vary. In a spherical dark matter halo we easily find models that fit the observed morphology. However, no plausible Pal 5 model could be found in the triaxial potential of Law & Majewski, which has been proposed to explain the properties of the Sagittarius stream. In this case, the long, thin, and curved morphology of the Pal 5 stream alone can be used to rule out such a potential configuration. Pal 5-like streams in this potential are either too straight, missing the curvature of the observations, or show an unusual morphology which we dub stream-fanning: a signature sensitive to the triaxiality of a potential. We conclude that the mere existence of other thin tidal streams must provide broad constraints on the orientation and shape of the dark matter halo they inhabit.},

	Abstract = {We report on a search for new wide halo binary stars in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82. A list of new halo wide binary candidates which satisfy common proper motion and photometric constraints is provided. The projected separations of the sample lie between 0.007 and 0.25 pc. Although the sample is not large enough to improve constraints on dark matter in the halo, we find the wide binary angular separation function is broadly consistent with past work. We discuss the significance of the new sample for a number of astrophysical applications, including as a testbed for ideas about wide binary formation. For the subset of candidates which have radial velocity information, we make use of integrals of motion to investigate one such scheme in which the origin of Galactic wide binaries is associated with the accretion/disruption of stellar systems in the Galaxy. Additional spectroscopic observations of these candidate binaries will strengthen their usefulness in many of these respects. Based on our search experience in Stripe 82 we estimate that the upcoming Pan-STARRS survey will increase the sample size of wide halo binaries by over an order of magnitude.},

	Abstract = {Astrometric surveys such as Gaia and LSST will measure parallaxes for hundreds of millions of stars. Yet they will not measure a single distance. Rather, a distance must be estimated from a parallax. In this didactic article, I show that doing this is not trivial once the fractional parallax error is larger than about 20%, which will be the case for about 80% of stars in the Gaia catalog. Estimating distances is an inference problem in which the use of prior assumptions is unavoidable. I investigate the properties and performance of various priors and examine their implications. A supposed uninformative uniform prior in distance is shown to give very poor distance estimates (large bias and variance). Any prior with a sharp cut-off at some distance has similar problems. The choice of prior depends on the information one has available---and is willing to use---concerning, e.g., the survey and the Galaxy. I demonstrate that a simple prior which decreases asymptotically to zero at infinite distance has good performance, accommodates nonpositive parallaxes, and does not require a bias correction.},

	Abstract = {Gaia Data Release 1 (Gaia DR1) contains astrometric results for more than 1 billion stars brighter than magnitude 20.7 based on observations collected by the Gaia satellite during the first 14 months of its operational phase. We give a brief overview of the astrometric content of the data release and of the model assumptions, data processing, and validation of the results. For stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues, complete astrometric single-star solutions are obtained by incorporating positional information from the earlier catalogues. For other stars only their positions are obtained by neglecting their proper motions and parallaxes. The results are validated by an analysis of the residuals, through special validation runs, and by comparison with external data. Results. For about two million of the brighter stars (down to magnitude ~11.5) we obtain positions, parallaxes, and proper motions to Hipparcos-type precision or better. For these stars, systematic errors depending e.g. on position and colour are at a level of 0.3 milliarcsecond (mas). For the remaining stars we obtain positions at epoch J2015.0 accurate to ~10 mas. Positions and proper motions are given in a reference frame that is aligned with the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) to better than 0.1 mas at epoch J2015.0, and non-rotating with respect to ICRF to within 0.03 mas/yr. The Hipparcos reference frame is found to rotate with respect to the Gaia DR1 frame at a rate of 0.24 mas/yr. Based on less than a quarter of the nominal mission length and on very provisional and incomplete calibrations, the quality and completeness of the astrometric data in Gaia DR1 are far from what is expected for the final mission products. The results nevertheless represent a huge improvement in the available fundamental stellar data and practical definition of the optical reference frame.},

	Abstract = {We present an overview of the Specific Objects Study (SOS) pipeline developed within the Coordination Unit 7 (CU7) of the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC), the coordination unit charged with the processing and analysis of variable sources observed by Gaia, to validate and fully characterise Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars observed by the spacecraft. We describe how the SOS for Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars (SOS Cep&RRL) was specifically tailored to analyse Gaia's G-band photometric time-series with a South Ecliptic Pole (SEP) footprint, which covers an external region of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). G-band time-series photometry and characterization by the SOS Cep&RRL pipeline (mean magnitude and pulsation characteristics) are published in Gaia Data Release 1 (Gaia DR1) for a total sample of 3,194 variable stars, 599 Cepheids and 2,595 RR Lyrae stars, of which 386 (43 Cepheids and 343 RR Lyrae stars) are new discoveries by Gaia. All 3,194 stars are distributed over an area extending 38 degrees on either side from a point offset from the centre of the LMC by about 3 degrees to the north and 4 degrees to the east. The vast majority, but not all, are located within the LMC. The published sample also includes a few bright RR Lyrae stars that trace the outer halo of the Milky Way in front of the LMC.},

@article{Gaia-Collaboration:2016aa,
	Abstract = {At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data release, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion sources brighter than magnitude 20.7. We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide illustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1 consists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The second component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of ~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas should be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000 Hipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas. The median uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to ~0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from the data.},

@article{Bovy:2015aa,
	Abstract = {I describe the design, implementation, and usage of galpy, a python package for galactic-dynamics calculations. At its core, galpy consists of a general framework for representing galactic potentials both in python and in C (for accelerated computations); galpy functions, objects, and methods can generally take arbitrary combinations of these as arguments. Numerical orbit integration is supported with a variety of Runge-Kutta-type and symplectic integrators. For planar orbits, integration of the phase-space volume is also possible. galpy supports the calculation of action-angle coordinates and orbital frequencies for a given phase-space point for general spherical potentials, using state-of-the-art numerical approximations for axisymmetric potentials, and making use of a recent general approximation for any static potential. A number of different distribution functions (DFs) are also included in the current release; currently, these consist of two-dimensional axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric disk DFs, a three-dimensional disk DF, and a DF framework for tidal streams. I provide several examples to illustrate the use of the code. I present a simple model for the Milky Way's gravitational potential consistent with the latest observations. I also numerically calculate the Oort functions for different tracer populations of stars and compare them to a new analytical approximation. Additionally, I characterize the response of a kinematically warm disk to an elliptical m = 2 perturbation in detail. Overall, galpy consists of about 54,000 lines, including 23,000 lines of code in the module, 11,000 lines of test code, and about 20,000 lines of documentation. The test suite covers 99.6% of the code. galpy is available at http://github.com/jobovy/galpy with extensive documentation available at http://galpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest.},

@article{Price-Whelan:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Several long, dynamically cold stellar streams have been observed around the Milky Way Galaxy, presumably formed from the tidal disruption of globular clusters. In integrable potentials - where all orbits are regular - tidal debris phase-mixes close to the orbit of the progenitor system. However, the Milky Way's dark matter halo is expected not to be fully integrable; an appreciable fraction of orbits will be chaotic. This paper examines the influence of chaos on the phase-space morphology of cold tidal streams. Streams even in weakly chaotic regions look very different from those in regular regions. We find that streams can be sensitive to chaos on a much shorter time-scale than any standard prediction (from the Lyapunov or frequency-diffusion times). For example, on a weakly chaotic orbit with a chaotic time-scale predicted to be >1000 orbital periods (>1000 Gyr), the resulting stellar stream is, after just a few 10's of orbits, substantially more diffuse than any formed on a nearby but regular orbit. We find that the enhanced diffusion of the stream stars can be understood by looking at the variance in orbital frequencies of orbit ensembles centred around the parent (progenitor) orbit. Our results suggest that long, cold streams around our Galaxy must exist only on regular (or very nearly regular) orbits; they potentially provide a map of the regular regions of the Milky Way potential. This suggests a promising new direction for the use of tidal streams to constrain the distribution of dark matter around our Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {Chemical evolution models are powerful tools for interpreting stellar abundance surveys and understanding galaxy evolution. However, their predictions depend heavily on the treatment of inflow, outflow, star formation efficiency (SFE), the IMF, the SNIa delay time distribution, stellar yields, and mixing of stellar populations. Using flexCE, a new, flexible one-zone chemical evolution code, we investigate the effects of individual parameters and the trade-offs between them. Two of the most important parameters are the SFE and outflow mass-loading parameter, which shift the knee in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] and the equilibrium abundances, respectively. One-zone models with simple star formation histories follow narrow tracks in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] that do not match the observed bimodality in this plane. A mix of one-zone models with variations in their inflow timescales and outflow mass-loading parameters, as motivated by the inside-out galaxy formation scenario with radial mixing, reproduces the high- and low-alpha sequences better than a single model with two infall epochs. We present [X/Fe]-[Fe/H] tracks for 20 elements assuming three different SN yield models and find some significant discrepancies with observations, especially for elements with strongly metallicity-dependent yields. Analyzing the high dimensional abundance space probed by surveys like APOGEE, GALAH, and Gaia-ESO will require more advanced statistical techniques. We applied one such technique, principal component abundance analysis, to the simulations and data to reveal the main correlations amongst abundances and quantify their contributions to variation in abundance space. PC1 and PC2 of the stellar population mixing scenario are dominated by alpha-elements and elements with metallicity-dependent yields, respectively, and they collectively explain 99% of the variance. flexCE is available at https://github.com/bretthandrews/flexCE.},

	Abstract = {It is suggested that the mass of the individual unseen 'disk things' which furnish unseen mass satisfies an inequality that is based on the demonstrated existence of a large number of wide binary stars in the Galaxy whose projected separations are as large as 0.1 pc. Since these binaries are weakly bound, with orbital velocities of 0.3 km/sec and periods of the order of 1 million years, they can be disrupted by passing stars or other pointlike objects. This implies that the mass of the unseen disk objects, which provide about half the local mass density, must be less than 2 solar masses.},

@article{Schiavon:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Formation of globular clusters (GCs), the Galactic bulge, or galaxy bulges in general, are important unsolved problems in Galactic astronomy. Homogeneous infrared observations of large samples of stars belonging to GCs and the Galactic bulge field are one of the best ways to study these problems. We report the discovery by APOGEE of a population of field stars in the inner Galaxy with abundances of N, C, and Al that are typically found in GC stars. The newly discovered stars have high [N/Fe], which is correlated with [Al/Fe] and anti-correlated with [C/Fe]. They are homogeneously distributed across, and kinematically indistinguishable from, other field stars in the same volume. Their metallicity distribution is seemingly unimodal, peaking at [Fe/H]~-1, thus being in disagreement with that of the Galactic GC system. Our results can be understood in terms of different scenarios. N-rich stars could be former members of dissolved GCs, in which case the mass in destroyed GCs exceeds that of the surviving GC system by a factor of ~8. In that scenario, the total mass contained in so-called "first-generation" stars cannot be larger than that in "second-generation" stars by more than a factor of ~9 and was certainly smaller. Conversely, our results may imply the absence of a mandatory genetic link between "second generation" stars and GCs. Last, but not least, N-rich stars could be the oldest stars in the Galaxy, the by-products of chemical enrichment by the first stellar generations formed in the heart of the Galaxy.},

@article{Penarrubia:2016aa,
	Abstract = {We carry out controlled $N$-body simulations that follow the dynamical evolution of binary stars in the dark matter (DM) haloes of ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals (dSphs). We find that wide binaries with semi-major axes $a\gtrsim a_t$ tend to be quickly disrupted by the tidal field of the halo. In smooth potentials the truncation scale, $a_t$, is mainly governed by (i) the mass enclosed within the dwarf half-light radius ($R_h$) and (ii) the slope of the DM halo profile at $R\approx R_h$, and is largely independent of the initial eccentricity distribution of the binary systems and the anisotropy of the stellar orbits about the galactic potential. For the reported velocity dispersion and half-light radius of Segue I, the closest ultra-faint, our models predict $a_t$ values that are a factor 2--3 smaller in cuspy haloes than in any of the cored models considered here. Using mock observations of Segue I we show that measuring the projected two-point correlation function of stellar pairs with sub-arcsecond resolution may provide a useful tool to constrain the amount and distribution of DM in the smallest and most DM-dominated galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present an improved catalog of halo wide binaries compiled from an extensive literature search. Most of our binaries stem from the common proper motion binary catalogs by Allen et al. and Chanam{\'e} & Gould, but we have also included binaries from the lists of Ryan and Zapatero-Osorio & Mart{\'\i}n. All binaries were carefully checked and their distances and systemic radial velocities are included when available. Probable membership to the halo population was tested by means of reduced proper motion diagrams for 251 candidate halo binaries. After eliminating obvious disk binaries, we ended up with 211 probable halo binaries, 150 of which have radial velocities available. We compute galactic orbits for these 150 binaries and calculate the time they spend within the galactic disk. Considering the full sample of 251 candidate halo binaries as well as several subsamples, we find that the distribution of angular separations (or expected major semiaxes) follows a power law f(a) ~ a -1 (Oepik's relation) up to different limits. For the 50 most disk-like binaries, those that spend their entire lives within z = $\pm$500 pc, this limit is found to be 19,000 AU (0.09 pc), while for the 50 most halo-like binaries, those that spend on average only 18% of their lives within z = $\pm$500 pc, the limit is 63,000 AU (0.31 pc). In a companion paper, we employ this catalog to establish limits on the masses of the halo massive perturbers (massive compact halo objects).},

	Abstract = {We present the Sloan Low-mass Wide Pairs of Kinematically Equivalent Stars (SLoWPoKES)-II catalog of low-mass visual binaries identified from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) by matching photometric distances. The candidate pairs are vetted by comparing the stellar information. The candidate pairs are vetted by comparing the stellar density at their respective Galactic positions to Monte Carlo realizations of a simulated Milky Way. In this way, we are able to identify large numbers of bona fide wide binaries without the need for proper motions. Here, 105,537 visual binaries with angular separations of ˜1-20" were identified, each with a probability of chance alignment of <=5%. This is the largest catalog of bona fide wide binaries to date, and it contains a diversity of systems---in mass, mass ratios, binary separations, metallicity, and evolutionary states---that should facilitate follow-up studies to characterize the properties of M dwarfs and white dwarfs. There is a subtle but definitive suggestion of multiple populations in the physical separation distribution, supporting earlier findings. We suggest that wide binaries are composed of multiple populations, most likely representing different formation modes. There are 141 M7 or later wide binary candidates, representing a seven-fold increase over the number currently known. These binaries are too wide to have been formed via the ejection mechanism. Finally, we found that 6% of spectroscopically confirmed M dwarfs are not included in the SDSS STAR catalog; they are misclassified as extended sources due to the presence of a nearby or partially resolved companion. The SLoWPoKES-II catalog is publicly available to the entire community on the World Wide Web via the Filtergraph data visualization portal.},

	Abstract = {We simulate the evolution of halo wide binaries in the presence of the massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) and compare our results to the sample of wide binaries in a companion paper. The observed distribution is well fitted by a single power law for angular separations, 3.5"<Deltatheta<900'', whereas the simulated distributions show a break in the power law whose location depends on the MACHO mass and density. This allows us to place upper limits on the density of MACHOs as a function of their assumed mass. At the 95% confidence level, we exclude MACHOs with masses M>43Msolar at the standard local halo density rhoH. This all but removes the last permitted window for a full MACHO halo for masses M>10-7.5Msolar.},

	Abstract = {In order to determine an upper bound for the mass of the massive compact halo objects (MACHOs), we use the halo binaries contained in a recent catalog by Allen & Monroy-Rodr{\'\i}guez. To dynamically model their interactions with massive perturbers, a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted, using an impulsive approximation method and assuming a galactic halo constituted by massive particles of a characteristic mass. The results of such simulations are compared with several subsamples of our improved catalog of candidate halo wide binaries. In accordance with Quinn et al., we also find our results to be very sensitive to the widest binaries. However, our larger sample, together with the fact that we can obtain galactic orbits for 150 of our systems, allows a more reliable estimate of the maximum MACHO mass than that obtained previously. If we employ the entire sample of 211 candidate halo stars we, obtain an upper limit of 112 M &sun;. However, using the 150 binaries in our catalog with computed galactic orbits, we are able to refine our fitting criteria. Thus, for the 100 most halo-like binaries we obtain a maximum MACHO mass of 21-68 M &sun;. Furthermore, we can estimate the dynamical effects of the galactic disk using binary samples that spend progressively shorter times within the disk. By extrapolating the limits obtained for our most reliable---albeit smallest---sample, we find that as the time spent within the disk tends to zero, the upper bound of the MACHO mass tends to less than 5 M &sun;. The non-uniform density of the halo has also been taken into account, but the limit obtained, less than 5 M &sun;, does not differ much from the previous one. Together with microlensing studies that provide lower limits on the MACHO mass, our results essentially exclude the existence of such objects in the galactic halo.},

	Abstract = {We present a survey of the theory of the Lyapunov Characteristic Exponents (LCEs) for dynamical systems, as well as of the numerical techniques developed for the computation of the maximal, of few and of all of them. After some historical notes on the first attempts for the numerical evaluation of LCEs, we discuss in detail the multiplicative ergodic theorem of Oseledec \cite{O_68}, which provides the theoretical basis for the computation of the LCEs. Then, we analyze the algorithm for the computation of the maximal LCE, whose value has been extensively used as an indicator of chaos, and the algorithm of the so--called `standard method', developed by Benettin et al. \cite{BGGS_80b}, for the computation of many LCEs. We also consider different discrete and continuous methods for computing the LCEs based on the QR or the singular value decomposition techniques. Although, we are mainly interested in finite--dimensional conservative systems, i. e. autonomous Hamiltonian systems and symplectic maps, we also briefly refer to the evaluation of LCEs of dissipative systems and time series. The relation of two chaos detection techniques, namely the fast Lyapunov indicator (FLI) and the generalized alignment index (GALI), to the computation of the LCEs is also discussed.},

	Abstract = {The positions and velocities of galaxies in the Local Group (LG) measure the gravitational field within it. This is mostly due to the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31). We constrain their masses using distance and radial velocity (RV) measurements of 32 LG galaxies. To do this, we follow the trajectories of many simulated particles starting on a pure Hubble flow at redshift 9. For each observed galaxy, we obtain a trajectory which today is at the same position. Its final velocity is the model prediction for the velocity of that galaxy. Unlike previous simulations based on spherical symmetry, ours are axisymmetric and include gravity from Centaurus A. We find the total LG mass is {4.33^{+0.37}_{-0.32}× {10}^{12} M_{&sun;}}, with 0.14 $\pm$ 0.07 of this being in the MW. We approximately account for IC 342, M81, the Great Attractor and the Large Magellanic Cloud. No plausible set of initial conditions yields a good match to the RVs of our sample of LG galaxies. Observed RVs systematically exceed those predicted by the best-fitting Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LambdaCDM) model, with a typical disagreement of {45.1^{+7.0}_{-5.7}} km s-1 and a maximum of 110 $\pm$ 13 km s-1 for DDO 99. Interactions between LG dwarf galaxies cannot easily explain this. One possibility is a past close flyby of the MW and M31. This arises in some modified gravity theories but not in LambdaCDM. Gravitational slingshot encounters of material in the LG with either of these massive fast-moving galaxies could plausibly explain why some non-satellite LG galaxies are moving away from us even faster than a pure Hubble flow.},

@article{Valluri:2016aa,
	Abstract = {We examine a large random sample of orbits in two self-consistent simulations of N-body bars. Orbits in these bars are classified both visually and with a new automated orbit classification method based on frequency analysis. The well-known prograde x1 orbit family originates from the same parent orbit as the box orbits in stationary and rotating triaxial ellipsoids. However, only a small fraction of bar orbits (~4%) have predominately prograde motion like their periodic parent orbit. Most bar orbits arising from the x1 orbit have little net angular momentum in the bar frame, making them equivalent to box orbits in rotating triaxial potentials. In these simulations a small fraction of bar orbits (~7%) are long-axis tubes that behave exactly like those in triaxial ellipsoids: they are tipped about the intermediate axis owing to the Coriolis force, with the sense of tipping determined by the sign of their angular momentum about the long axis. No orbits parented by prograde periodic x2 orbits are found in the pure bar model, but a tiny population (~2%) of short-axis tube orbits parented by retrograde x4 orbits are found. When a central point mass representing a supermassive black hole (SMBH) is grown adiabatically at the center of the bar, those orbits that lie in the immediate vicinity of the SMBH are transformed into precessing Keplerian orbits that belong to the same major families (short-axis tubes, long-axis tubes and boxes) occupying the bar at larger radii. During the growth of an SMBH, the inflow of mass and outward transport of angular momentum transform some x1 and long-axis tube orbits into prograde short-axis tubes. This study has important implications for future attempts to constrain the masses of SMBHs in barred galaxies using orbit-based methods like the Schwarzschild orbit superposition scheme and for understanding the observed features in barred galaxies.},

@article{Manos:2013aa,
	Abstract = {We study the distinction and quantification of chaotic and regular motion in a time-dependent Hamiltonian barred galaxy model. Recently, a strong correlation was found between the strength of the bar and the presence of chaotic motion in this system, as models with relatively strong bars were shown to exhibit stronger chaotic behavior compared to those having a weaker bar component. Here, we attempt to further explore this connection by studying the interplay between chaotic and regular behavior of star orbits when the parameters of the model evolve in time. This happens for example when one introduces linear time dependence in the mass parameters of the model to mimic, in some general sense, the effect of self-consistent interactions of the actual N-body problem. We thus observe, in this simple time-dependent model also, that the increase of the bar's mass leads to an increase of the system's chaoticity. We propose a new way of using the generalized alignment index (GALI) method as a reliable criterion to estimate the relative fraction of chaotic versus regular orbits in such time-dependent potentials, which proves to be much more efficient than the computation of Lyapunov exponents. In particular, GALI is able to capture subtle changes in the nature of an orbit (or ensemble of orbits) even for relatively small time intervals, which makes it ideal for detecting dynamical transitions in time-dependent systems.  This article is part of a special issue of Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical devoted to `Lyapunov analysis: from dynamical systems theory to applications'.},

	Abstract = {The shape and stability of possible orbits in a realistic 3D barred galaxy model are numerically studied. The model is analytically described, including the axisymmetric component, the bar component, parameters, Hamiltonian, and stability of periodic orbits. All principal families of periodic orbits are described. The influence of the main families on the nonperiodic orbits is estimated using the surface of section technique. The change in stability due to the variation of the mass and the axial ratios of the bar is analyzed. It is concluded that many vertical instability strips of direct plane orbits exclude plane motion and modify conclusions drawn from 2D studies. One of these instability strips can explain the cushion or box shapes of the bulge of some galaxies seen edge-on. Such bulges would contain mostly 4/1 z-oscillating stars, and would be indicators of the existence of a bar. Bar growth is limited by increasing vertical as well as horizontal instability, which favors ergodic motion.},

@article{Machado:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Studies of dynamical stability (chaotic versus regular motion) in galactic dynamics often rely on static analytical models of the total gravitational potential. Potentials based upon self-consistent N-body simulations offer more realistic models, fully incorporating the time-dependent nature of the systems. Here we aim at analysing the fractions of chaotic motion within different morphological components of the galaxy. We wish to investigate how the presence of chaotic orbits evolves with time, and how their spatial distribution is associated with morphological features of the galaxy. We employ a time-dependent analytical potential model that was derived from an N-body simulation of a strongly barred galaxy. With this analytical potential, we may follow the dynamical evolution of ensembles of orbits. Using the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) chaos detection method, we study the fraction of chaotic orbits, sampling the dynamics of both the stellar disc and of the dark matter halo. Within the stellar disc, the global trend is for chaotic motion to decrease in time, specially in the region of the bar. We scrutinized the different changes of regime during the evolution (orbits that are permanently chaotic, permanently regular, those that begin regular and end chaotic, and those that begin chaotic and end regular), tracing the types of orbits back to their common origins. Within the dark matter halo, chaotic motion also decreases globally in time. The inner halo (r < 5 kpc) is where most chaotic orbits are found and it is the only region where chaotic orbits outnumber regular orbits, in the early evolution.},

	Abstract = {Context. The VISTA Variable Survey (VVV) is able to map the Galaxy at l <= 0$\,^{\circ}$ with an unpaired depth (at least 3 mag deeper than 2MASS), opening new possibilities for studying the inner structure of the Milky Way.  Aims: In this paper we concentrate on the exploitation of these data to better understand the spatial disposition and distribution of the structures present in the inner Milky Way, particularly the Long Bar and its interaction with the inner disc.  Methods: To attain this, we present the Ks vs. J - Ks diagrams obtained with VVV of regions with (-20$\,^{\circ}$ < l < -8$\,^{\circ}$, |b| < 2$\,^{\circ}$). From them we derive the distribution of red clump giants with heliocentric distance as a proxy for the overall stellar structure of the Galaxy. Along with these diagrams, we analysed the distribution of photometrically selected red supergiants, in order to detect events of recent stellar formation.  Results: The observations show the presence of a clear overdensity of stars with associated recent stellar formation that we interpret as the traces of the Long Bar, and we derive an angle for it of 41$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 5$\,^{\circ}$ with the Sun-Galactic centre line, touching the disc near l = 27$\,^{\circ}$ and l = -12$\,^{\circ}$. The colour-magnitude diagrams presented here also show a lack of disc stars in several lines of sight, a fact that we associate with the truncation of the disc by the potential of this bar for RGC <= 5 kpc.

Using chi2 minimization, we find that the best-fitting Galactic bar model has a pattern speed Omegap = 60 km s-1 kpc-1, disc mass Md = 1.0 × 1011 M&sun; and bar angle thetabar = 20$\,^{\circ}$ for an adopted bar mass Mbar = 2 × 1010 M&sun;. The model can reproduce not only the three-dimensional and projected density distributions but also velocity and velocity dispersion data from the Bulge Radial Velocity Assay (BRAVA) survey. We also predict the proper motions in the range l = [-12$\,^{\circ}$, 12$\,^{\circ}$], b = [-10$\,^{\circ}$, 10$\,^{\circ}$], which appear to be higher than observations in the longitudinal direction. The model is stable within a time-scale of 0.5 Gyr, but appears to deviate from steady state on longer time-scales. Our model can be further tested by future observations such as those from GAIA.},
